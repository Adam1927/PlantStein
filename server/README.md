# Server

This folder contains the code and documentation for the server and database.
For now, the server uses a in-memory H2 database. Upon startup, Spring will add the data from `data.sql`.

## Swagger UI

This project uses Swagger UI to document the API.
The documentation is automatically generated by the method signatures and annotations above the methods.

It can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
